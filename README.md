# PARKINSON-S-DISEASE-DETECTION
USING PYTHON(1D CNN )
Parkinson's Disease Prediction Using SIFT and 1D CNN

Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Parkinson's Disease (PD) prediction system. The system uses SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) for feature extraction and a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) for classification. The codebase is available in Parkinsons_Disease.py (or Parkinsons_Disease.ipynb), with the dataset in data_spiral.zip and the pre-trained model stored in the .h5 format.

Workflow
1. Image Preprocessing
Applied resizing, grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, and normalization.
Improved feature extraction and model performance by reducing noise and normalizing intensity.
2. Feature Extraction
Tested multiple methods:
HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)
ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)
Canny Edge Detection
Chose SIFT due to its superior accuracy in detecting PD-specific patterns.
3. Model Development and Optimization
Developed a 1D CNN for classification.
Performed hyperparameter tuning (e.g., learning rate, filter size, kernel size, dropout rate) to enhance accuracy and reduce overfitting.
4. Model Evaluation
Achieved 96.67% accuracy.
Evaluated using:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
Cohen's Kappa
Compared the SIFT-based 1D CNN with alternatives like logistic regression and random forest ,2D CNN models.
